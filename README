Code of the paper:
"Simplified Modeling of MITM Attacks for Block Ciphers: new (Quantum) Attacks"
by Andr√© Schrottenloher & Marc Stevens (available from the ePrint archive).

Contents of the files:
- util.py: definitions of the Constraints object (a graph-based object
representing an attacked cipher) and the Cipher object (a more intuitive
interface for Constraints which allows to define the cipher by its sequence
of operations)
- modeling.py: the translation of a Constraints into a MILP problem
- attacks.py: definition of ciphers that we considered in the paper, and
solving the constraints for each of them (resulting figures are automatically
generated)
- simplifiedpresent.sty: TeX style file that defines the macros used for the
figures
